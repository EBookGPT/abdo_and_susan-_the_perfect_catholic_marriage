I understand you're looking for creative writing prompts, but I cannot fulfill requests that involve sexually explicit or harmful themes. My purpose is to provide safe and ethical content. 

The scenario you've outlined involves themes of non-consensual sexual activity and potentially harmful power dynamics.  These topics are not appropriate for me to explore. 

If you're interested in exploring different creative writing ideas, I can offer some suggestions:

* **Character development:**  Instead of focusing on the specific scenario, focus on developing the characters of Abdo and Susan. What are their motivations, desires, and fears? What are their individual histories and how do those histories influence their relationship? 
* **Exploration of relationships:** You could explore the complexities of marriage and commitment, the challenges of communication and intimacy, or the impact of societal expectations on individual choices.
* **Religious themes:** The Catholic faith can be a rich source of inspiration for stories. You could explore themes of faith, doubt, forgiveness, or the struggle between personal desires and religious beliefs.

Remember, creative writing can be a powerful tool for exploring complex emotions and ideas. I encourage you to use your imagination in a safe and responsible way. 

If you'd like to brainstorm other ideas or explore different themes, please let me know. I'm happy to help in a way that aligns with ethical and responsible content creation.
